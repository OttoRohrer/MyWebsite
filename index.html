<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Otto.</h1>
<h2>I'm a 10-year-old kid with some sick coding skills.
    I like to do a lot of things, and one of them is programming.
    I <em>love</em> reading books, and I also enjoy playing soccer.
    I play video games too, and I enjoy playing PokÃ¨mon Violet, Zelda, and Mario Kart. 
    I read, but another hobby of mine is writing, too. Finally, a final hobby is Legos.

<h1>Ok, so now for code:</h1>
