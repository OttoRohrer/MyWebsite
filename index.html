  <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Otto.</h1>
  <h2>I'm a 10-year-old kid with some sick coding skills.
      I like to do a lot of things, and one of them is programming.
      I <em>love</em> reading books, and I also enjoy playing soccer.
      I play video games too, and I enjoy playing PokÃ¨mon Violet, Zelda, and Mario Kart. 
      I read, but another hobby of mine is writing, too. Finally, a final hobby is Legos.

  <h1>Ok, so now for code:</h1>

    <li><a href="./snake.html">Play the Snake Game!</a></li>
    <li><a href="./breakout.html">Play Breakout too!</a></li>
    <li><a href="./tictactoe.html">Play Tic Tac Toe!</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Some of my skills:</h1>
  <h2>
    I am an amateur JS coder, and I can do some JavaScript basics.
    On a 1 - 10 scale of JS knowledge, I might rate myself a 6.
    I use JS a lot and I feel comfortable in that world;
    but I can also use basic HTML and CSS.
    On HTML 1 - 10 rating, I think I'd be a 5.
    On CSS though, I'm at about a 3;
    I an do amateur HTML, but only some basic CSS.
